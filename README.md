Background: From our medical volunteering and training experience, one of us witnessed an elderly patient take his blood pressure pills 
twice, resulting in a severe case of hypotension, which soon lead to intense trembling and painful breath intakes. According to our 
research, this critical situation is ongoing both at homes and at health care residences. Both geriatric patients and regular people have 
found themselves in life-threatening situations because they have simply forgotten to take their pills or have taken the wrong dosage. 
These situations are especially prevalent in patients who have diseases, such as, Alzheimer's and patients coming from a low-income 
background.

Medication non-compliance is one of the most critical healthcare problem that needs to be addressed today. Non-compliance can have 
negative consequences not only for the patient, (ex: a sickness that is worsened with time and anti-bacteria resistance from taking too 
much medication) but also for the health care provider's system (Medicaid's debt is increasing every year due to the patient incidents). 
Because it is a major, public health problem, it is necessary to reduce those preventable hospitalizations by taking any measures 
possible.

Mission: By creating this database, our aim is to prevent both geriatric patients and common patients from putting themselves in danger. 
Our aimed focus is on the most vulnerable populations who have limited medical knowledge and do not have access to expensive services that 
would prevent them from these situations.

Our proposed solution: A simple, but innovative voice-call pill-reminder that can function in several, diverse languages, so everyone will 
have access and will be capable of using it. => No need to be a tech savy

Advantages of using this website: => No language barrier => No need of having a smartphone => No in-depth reading required from the users 
=> A simple sign-up which can be made by the families, nurses, or Home Health Aides

To conclude, the simplicity of this product will help the users to take their medication regularly, and it will also improve their 
response to new technology

How this product was made: The automated voice-call function was made using Twilio A Sign-up page was created to store database Languages 
used: Python, HTML, Javascript

Further extension of the project: -Completed project will be presented to primary care providers and hospitals -Technology used can be 
integrated onto wearable devices, so users do not need to carry phones around or rely on a landline. -Can be implemented on various voice-
activated devices- the Echo and/or Mini-Homes as well as other home automation devices
