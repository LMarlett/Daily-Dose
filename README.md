Daily-Dose

Problem: From my volunteering experience, I witnessed a old man who took his blood pressure pills twice which lead to constant trembling and spinning. Accoding to our research, this is actually a very common scenario. Many elderely people were in life threatening situation because they forgot to take their medecine or took the wrong dose, especially those who have Alhzeimer and those coming from low-income background.

Aim: Prevent elderly people from putting themselves into danger- Focus on those who dont have access to expensive medical services.
     
Solution: A voice-call pill-reminder that can be used in several languages. It's a simple systemn so that everyone can have access to it. 
=> No need to be savy tech
