Daily-Dose

Problem: From our volunteering experience, one of us witnessed an old man who took his blood pressure pills twice, which lead to intense trembling and painfull shortness of breath. 
According to our research, this is actually an ongoing scenario in hospitals. Many elderely people found themselves in life threatening situations because they forgot to take their pills or took the wrong dose, especially those who have Alhzeimer and those coming from low-income background.

Why: Medication non compliance is one of the biggest healthcare problem that needs to be 
It can have negative consequences not only for the patient(ex: sickeness worsens with time, anti-bacteria resistance) but also for the health care provider's system (Medicaid's debt is increasing every year).
Because it is a major public health problem, it is necessary to reduce those preventable hospitalizations.

Aim: Prevent elderly people from putting themselves in danger, therefore being re-admitted to hospitals .
     Focus on the most vulnerable population who have limited medical knowledge and don't have access to expensive services.
     
     
Our proposed solution: A voice-call pill-reminder that can be used in several languages. It's a simple systemn so that everyone can have access to it. 
=> No need to be savy tech
=> No need of having a smartphone
=> a simple sign-up made by the patients' families, nurses, Home Health Aides
=> do not require any reading from the users

How:
Create a automated voice-call using Twilio
Create a Sign-up page to store database
Language used: Python, 

Extension of the project:
Integrate the product on wearable devices, they don't have to carry phones around anymore
Implement this service on Echo Dots, Mini-Homes
